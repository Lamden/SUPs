## Queries Should Feel Like Variables

Consider: 

`s_balance = balances.select().where(balances.address == sender).run()`

If we want to update this balance, we have to rerun a new query against the database rather then against this query specifically like so:

```
balances.update([{
            'amount': s_balance['amount'] + amount
        }]).where(balances.address == receiver).run()
```

This makes little sense considering that the `s_balance` object already has all of the information it needs to perform an update query baked into itself:

* columns
* values
* corresponding table

I propose a new interface that would cut down in total LOC required to update a variable that has been pulled from the DB. The interface would feel like this:

```
s_balance = balances.select().where(balances.address == sender).run()

s_balance['amount'] -= 10

s_balance.commit()
```

This interface feels better for several reasons. For one, it splits the transformational logic from the updating logic. Modification to the values inside of the variable should not exist inline or on the fly of committing the value because it could fail. Creating a new variable to store the information seems redundant. Secondly, commit() feels like it is an action running locally to the variable it is being called from which informs the developer that their actions are not modifying the entire DB, but just this variable in the DB.

### Inserting, Updating, Deleting

The same idea can cascade to the other types of database operations.

```
wallet = balances.new()
wallet.amount = 100
wallet.owner = 'stu'
wallet.commit()
```

```
wallet = balances.where(owner == 'stu')
wallet.delete()
```

### Why Change Against the Status Quo

Seneca derives its DB methods from SQLAlchemy which is probably the most popular Python database driver. This allows us to tap into a vast resource of developers that already exist and are familiar with SQLAlchemy.

However, production SQLAlchemy is generally done with their ORM interface, which is how it is utilized in the popular web framework Django. Fewer people actually use the 'raw' SQL query construction methods.

The raw SQL interface is not Pythonic and exists in its own box. It is verbose and pretty ugly. By abstracting it, even if though a simple wrapper on top of the Seneca SQL Intermediary libraries, it becomes much cleaner and pretty. :)

### Next Steps

I'm seeking feedback. Do people agree with this assessment? Is the interface that I provided optimal? Does it make sense to you as a developer?
